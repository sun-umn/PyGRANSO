# CPU/CUDA test notebooks

These notebooks run the same problems as in `examples/` but are set up to test PyGRANSO on both CPU and CUDA. They mirror the main examples (A1–A3, B1–B3, C1–C3, D1–D3) for compatibility and regression testing.

Run from the project root, e.g.:

```bash
jupyter notebook cuda_examples/A1_rosenbrock_cpu_cuda_test.ipynb
```
