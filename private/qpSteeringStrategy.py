        qpSteeringStrategy:
            attempts to find a search direction which promotes progress towards
            feasibility.  

            INPUT:
               penaltyfn_at_x  struct containing fields for:
               .mu             current penalty parameter
               .f_grad         gradient of objective function at x
               .ci             inequality constraints evaluated at x 
               .ci_grad        corresponding gradients at x
               .ce             equality constraints evaluated at x
               .ce_grad        corresponding gradients at x
               .tv_l1          total violation value at x (one norm)
               .tv             total violation value at x (infinity norm)

               l1_model        logical: determines whether or not the one norm 
                               (the standard choice) or the infinity norm is used
                               for the total violation measure, which affects the
                               predicted violation reduction.

               ineq_margin     real value in [0,inf] setting the margin of 
                               feasibility for problems having only inequality 
                               constraints.  In this case, steering is selectively 
                               disabled when the inequality constraints are all at 
                               least ineq_margin away from being active.  Setting 
                               ineq_margin to zero means that steering will only 
                               be applied when one or more inequality constraints 
                               are active ( >= 0).  Setting ineq_margin to inf 
                               means that steering will be applied on every 
                               iteration.  NOTE: this parameter has no effect if 
                               equality constraints are present.

               apply_Hinv      function handle apply_Hinv(x)
                               returns b = Hinv*x where Hinv is the inverse
                               Hessian (or approximation to it).  Hinv must be
                               positive definite.  x may be a single column or
                               matrix.

               maxit           max iteration count to try lowering penalty 
                               parameter mu in order to find a good search 
                               direction

               c_viol          percentage of total violation needed to be acheived
                               by the predicted reduction for a candidate 
                               direction must be in (0,1)

               c_mu            scalar factor to reduce penalty paremeter mu on 
                               each iterative if resulting direction is not 
                               acceptable must be in (0,1)

               quadprog_opts   struct of options for quadprog interface.
                               It must be provided but it may be set as []

            OUTPUT:
               d               candidate search direction
                               d will be set to [] if all QP solves fail hard

               mu              possibly lower value of the penalty parameter 

               reduction       amount of total violation reduction d is predicted 
                               to yield via the linearized constraint model

            THROWS:
               error           if any call to quadprog either throws an error
                               (which will be set as .cause of the GRANSO error)
                               or if quadprog returns without error but its answer 
                               is numerically invalid (e.g. inf, nan, empty, zero)
