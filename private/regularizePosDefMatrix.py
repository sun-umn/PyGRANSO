def regularizePosDefMatrix(  A, condnum_limit, limit_max_eigenvalues ):
    """
    regularizePosDefMatrix:
        Regularizes a dense positive definite matrix A so that its 
        condition number never exceeds threshold.  If regularization is 
        needed, i.e. cond(A) > threshold, its eigenvalue decomposition is 
        formed and the regularization is done by either shifting the 
        largest eigenvalue(s) downward or by shifting the smallest 
        eigenvalue(s) upward, so that the new eigenvalues satisfy 
        lambda_max / lambda_min == threshold.

        INPUT:
            A           
                dense positive definite matrix
                - if A is not positive definite, result will be wrong
                - if A is sparse, output will be unchanged sparse A

            threshold   
                maximum condition number of A allowed  
                - regularization only happens for cond(A) > threshold
                - may be set to inf (no regularization ever)

            limit_max_eigenvalues
                - true: shift largest eigenvalues downward 
                - false: shift smalleset eigenvalues upward

        OUTPUT:
            Areg  
                possibly regularized version of A
                cond(Areg) <= threshold always holds.

            info
                Integer code in  {0,1,2} indicating the result
                0       A was regularized
                1       A was not regularized, either because its condition
                        number did not exceed the threshold condnum_limit or 
                        because A was a sparse matrix.
